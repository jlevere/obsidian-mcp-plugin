# MCP plugin for Obsidian

Run an MCP directly as a plugin in Obsidian rather than using a wrapper on [obsidian-local-rest-api](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api).

## Helpful references

[mnaoumov/obsidian-dev-utils](https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-dev-utils?tab=readme-ov-file#cli-commands) GREAT info about debugging stuffs for plugin debugging.
